
  You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  - Use Zod for form validation.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
